# Start binding and joining datasets. 
# My goal for putting these sheets together is to start from the earliest date (January 20,2013).
# All dates will be included, including dates I did not run. When all data is loaded, I will use iso_week() to add the week number to each year (Monday - Sunday). This will allow me to track run frequency as a variable.
# All variables will be included and there will be a lot of NAs from 2013 through 2019 as a result.
