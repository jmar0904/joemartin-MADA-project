Processing code includes data that is not used in the final project. However, since I already wrote code to clean that data and had it mixed in with my code used to clean my primary data source, I left it in and will keep some results in a supplementary folder.

In order to reproduce this project, begin in the processing_code folder and run the R script in there. Then, run the `exploratory_analysis.R` script, followed by `modeling_performance.Rmd`. 

Resulting figures from the exploratory analysis script will go to the `figures` folder and will be used in the final manuscript.
